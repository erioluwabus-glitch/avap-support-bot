## Date: October 2, 2025

This document tracks all critical fixes and improvements applied to the AVAP Support Bot codebase.

---

## ‚úÖ CRITICAL BUGS FIXED

### 1. **Syntax Error in sheets_service.py** (CRITICAL)
**File:** `avap_bot/services/sheets_service.py`
**Issue:** Duplicate return statements in `get_student_questions()` function (lines 562-566)
**Fix:** Removed duplicate exception handling block
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

### 2. **Missing Variable in ask_question Function**
**File:** `avap_bot/handlers/student.py`
**Issue:** `file_name` variable not initialized when question type is text
**Fix:** Added `file_name = None` for text questions
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

### 3. **Missing Answer Button in Questions Group**
**File:** `avap_bot/handlers/student.py`
**Issue:** Answer button missing from questions forwarded to questions group (line 538 was empty)
**Fix:** Added proper inline keyboard with Answer button containing telegram_id and username
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

### 4. **Missing Answer Handler**
**File:** `avap_bot/handlers/questions.py` (NEW FILE)
**Issue:** No handler to process answers from admin
**Fix:** Created complete answer handler with:
- Answer callback for button clicks
- Text/audio/video answer support  
- Automatic notification to students
- Google Sheets status update
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

### 5. **Scheduler Not Initialized**
**File:** `avap_bot/bot.py`
**Issue:** Daily tips scheduler was never initialized or started
**Fix:** 
- Imported APScheduler
- Created scheduler instance
- Called `schedule_daily_tips()` during initialization
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

### 6. **Admin Verify Callback Error**
**File:** `avap_bot/handlers/admin.py`
**Issue:** Function called with wrong number of parameters (username parameter doesn't exist)
**Fix:** Updated to call with correct signature: `promote_pending_to_verified(pending_id, telegram_id=None)`
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

### 7. **Student Verification Parameter Error**
**File:** `avap_bot/handlers/student.py`
**Issue:** Calling `promote_pending_to_verified` with username parameter that doesn't exist
**Fix:** Removed username parameter, keeping only telegram_id
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

### 8. **Grading System Function Signature Mismatch**
**File:** `avap_bot/services/sheets_service.py`
**Issue:** Grading handlers calling `update_submission_grade(username, module, grade)` but function expected `(submission_id, grade, comment)`
**Fix:** Made function support both calling patterns:
- Legacy: `update_submission_grade(username, module, grade, comment)`
- New: `update_submission_grade(submission_id, grade, comment)`
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

### 9. **Missing Question Status Update Function**
**File:** `avap_bot/services/sheets_service.py`
**Issue:** No function to update question status when answered

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINING ISSUES TO ADDRESS

### HIGH PRIORITY

1. **Duplicate Student Detection** (CRITICAL SECURITY)
   - **Issue:** No validation to prevent same email/phone being used by multiple students
   - **Impact:** Students could create multiple accounts
   - **Fix Needed:** Add unique constraint checking in `add_student_email` handler
   - **File:** `avap_bot/handlers/admin.py`

2. **Support Group /ask Command**
   - **Issue:** No handler for questions sent via `/ask <question>` in support group
   - **Requirement:** Questions from support group should forward to questions group with proper tagging
   - **Fix Needed:** Add message handler for support group that detects `/ask` pattern
   - **File:** Create new handler or extend `avap_bot/handlers/student.py`

3. **/match Command Not Registered**
   - **Issue:** Match handler exists but not registered in handlers/__init__.py
   - **Impact:** /match command won't work
   - **Fix Needed:** Already registered in student handlers, verify it's working
   - **File:** `avap_bot/handlers/matching.py`

4. **Tip Rotation Logic**
   - **Issue:** Current logic uses modulo for rotation, should alternate AI vs manual
   - **Requirement:** Monday=AI, Tuesday=manual, Wednesday=AI, etc.
   - **Fix Needed:** Update `_get_daily_tip_content()` to track day and alternate
   - **File:** `avap_bot/handlers/tips.py`

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

5. **Assignment Status Update After Grading**
   - **Issue:** Status needs to update from "Pending" to "Graded" in sheets
   - **Fix:** Already implemented in updated `update_submission_grade()` function
   - **Verify:** Test that status column updates correctly

6. **Win Sharing to Support Group**
   - **Verify:** Ensure wins are properly forwarded to support group as motivation
   - **File:** `avap_bot/handlers/student.py` lines 379-396

7. **Student Removal - Access Revocation**
   - **Issue:** Need to ensure removed students can't access bot features
   - **Current:** Removal updates status in Supabase, bans from support group
   - **Verify:** Test that removed students get proper error messages

### LOW PRIORITY

8. **Error Messages and Admin Notifications**
   - **Status:** Basic error handling exists
   - **Improvement:** Add more specific error messages for common failures
   - **Test:** Verify admin gets notified for all critical errors

9. **FAQ AI Integration**
   - **Status:** Not yet implemented
   - **Requirement:** Auto-answer questions from FAQ database before forwarding to admin
   - **Note:** This was mentioned as "not set up yet" in requirements

## üìù CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS

1. **Handler Registration**
   - All handlers properly registered in `avap_bot/handlers/__init__.py`
   - Questions handler added to registration list

2. **Error Handling**
   - Try-catch blocks in all critical functions
   - Admin notifications for failures
   - Graceful degradation (e.g., CSV fallback for sheets)

3. **Logging**
   - Comprehensive logging throughout
   - Info, warning, and error levels properly used
   - Helps debugging in production (Render)
