# FINAL FIX - AVAP Support Bot

## Summary
This document consolidates the final fixes applied to ensure the bot operates reliably across verification, removal, grading, wins, FAQ reuse, multi-language, and persistence. It includes issues, root causes, actions taken, environment/setup notes, and how to test each item end-to-end.

## Environment and Setup
- Python: 3.11.x (Render uses runtime.txt)
- Persistent DB: SQLite at `/data/bot.db` (set by default; override with `DB_PATH`)
- Core env vars:
  - Telegram: `BOT_TOKEN`
  - Admins/Groups: `ADMIN_IDS`, `ASSIGNMENTS_GROUP_ID`, `QUESTIONS_GROUP_ID`
  - Systeme.io: `SYSTEME_API_KEY` (aka SYSTEME_IO_API_KEY in code), `SYSTEME_VERIFIED_STUDENT_TAG_ID`, `SYSTEME_ACHIEVER_TAG_ID`, `SYSTEME_KEEP_CONTACT_ON_REMOVE`
  - Google Sheets: `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` and `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`
  - OpenAI: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - I18n: `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`
- Scheduling: APScheduler is enabled for Daily Tips and FAQ checks

## Final Fixes

### 1) Google Sheets updates
- Added Submissions sheet logging on submission
- Added grading updates (status, score, comment) on finalize
- Added Wins sheet logging on shared win
- Verified existing Verifications sheet updates for add/verify/remove

How to test:
- Submit an assignment: new row in `Submissions`
- Grade it: row updated with `Graded`, `score`, `comment`
- Share win: new row in `Wins`
- Add/verify student: rows in `Verifications` are created/updated

### 2) Systeme.io integration robustness
- Unified client handles non-JSON responses (e.g., empty 204) and retries
- Contact lookup more tolerant; proceeds to creation if search fails
- Tag verification errors do not crash; admin notified when needed

How to test:
- Verify a student; check contact created/updated and tagged
- Simulate 422/429 via bad params/rate limit; bot should not crash and should notify admin

### 3) Remove Student flow reliability
- Confirmation handlers and states verified
- Identifier lookup normalized (email/ID/name, case-insensitive name)
- Systeme.io deprovision uses robust client

How to test:
- `/remove_student email,name,id` → confirm → enter reason → DB/Sheets/Systeme updated; student notified

### 4) Grading flow stability
- Resolved UnboundLocalError for text comments with guards
- Single ConversationHandler with well-defined states

How to test:
- Grade submission → choose comment text → send message → saved and student notified; Sheets updated

### 5) Share Win states
- Added `WIN_TYPE` state in ConversationHandler, ensuring buttons respond

How to test:
- Tap Text/Image/Video then send content; stored, forwarded, Sheets `Wins` row created

### 6) FAQ reuse improvements
- Immediate reuse suggestion in `/ask` based on `faq_history` similarity
- Hourly job still drafts AI answers when unanswered

How to test:
- Ask a previously answered/similar question; bot replies with suggested prior answer immediately, still forwards to support

### 7) Multi-language application
- `reply_translated` used for key DM messages; language fetched from DB
- Ensure you set language via `/setlang` (in `features/multilanguage.py`)

How to test:
- `/setlang es` then `/start`, `/status` – messages appear in Spanish

### 8) DB persistence on redeploy
- DB path defaults to `/data/bot.db`; directory is created on startup

How to test:
- Verify students; redeploy; data remains intact

## Known Requirements
- Ensure Google Sheets credentials and sheet ID are valid for full logging
- Ensure Systeme.io API key and tag IDs are correct

## Smoke Checklist
- Verify student: activation flow + Systeme.io tag
- Remove student: confirmation + deprovision
- Submit & grade: Sheets row add + update
- Share win: Sheets row add
- FAQ reuse: immediate suggestion on `/ask`
- I18n: `/setlang` affects `/start` and `/status`
- Persistence: data persists across redeploys
